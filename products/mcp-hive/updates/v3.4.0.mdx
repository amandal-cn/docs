**For Developers:**
- Simple toggle to enable async mode for any tool
- Webhook-based progress reporting system
- Webhook URLs automatically provided in headers (`MCPHive-Webhook` and `Ephor-Webhook`)
- Follow our [progress update contract](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tX5W0GiEyFblomdqf29m1pIPxe1kuVna4dzwjarH9Gw/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ufrleqbo7rh6) to send progress events seamlessly
