## Major Enhancements

### Unified Installation Experience
- Introduced `@mcp-hive/cli` for streamlined installation across multiple clients
- Support for `Claude`, `Cursor`, `Windsurf`, `Cline`, and more platforms
- Simple one-line installation command with interactive configuration

### ðŸ”’ Enterprise-Grade Security
- Your credentials are now protected with multi-layer encryption at rest
  ```mermaid
  graph LR
    A[Your Credentials] --> B[Encrypted with DEK]
    B --> C[DEK encrypted with Master Key]
    style A fill:#ff69b4,stroke:#fff,color:#fff
    style B fill:#4169e1,stroke:#fff,color:#fff
    style C fill:#32cd32,stroke:#fff,color:#fff
  ```
    <Note>Each user gets their own Data Encryption Key (DEK) which encrypts their sensitive data. This DEK itself is encrypted using a master key managed by a secure Key Management Service (KMS).</Note>
- Mandatory `API key` authentication for all MCP servers

### Dynamic Authorization System
- Runtime authorization flow eliminates the need for pre-authorization of hives
- Magic authorization links that LLMs can interpret and present to users
- Seamless authorization process without client restart

### Support for Local-Only Services
- New local mode enables hives to run directly on user machines
- Gives us capabily to support services requiring local machine access like Obsidian integration, file system operations
- Stay tuned for local-only hives - coming over the next few days!

### Ownership Management
Transfer ownership of a hive to another user with few clicks

- New owner receives an email with a link to accept the ownership
- Current owner can cancel the ownership transfer at any time before the new owner accepts it

Watch how ownership transfer works:
