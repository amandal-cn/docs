## Tool

A tool is a function that an LLM can invoke to perform specific actions or access external capabilities. Tools are the building blocks of MCP servers and represent discrete functionalities like:

- `create_google_doc(file_name)` - Create a new Google Doc
- `read_file(file_path)` - Read the contents of a file
- `summarize_text(text)` - Generate a summary of provided text
- `search_web(query)` - Perform a web search

Tools follow the [MCP specification for tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools) and include parameters, return types, and descriptions that help LLMs understand how to use them.

## Hive

A hive is a blueprint for an MCP server that defines what capabilities (tools) it offers to LLMs. Think of it as a collection of tools packaged together for a specific purpose.

You can create hives in two ways:
1. **From API Specifications**: Convert your existing APIs into an MCP Hive by uploading OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
2. **From Existing Tools**: Mix and match pre-built capabilities to create powerful custom hives without writing code

<Note>
  When a hive is added to a workspace and properly configured, it acts as a functional MCP server that LLMs can connect to and use.

## Workspace

Your workspace is where you manage your MCP servers:
- Add hives to make them operational
- Configure authentication and connection details
- Get connection URLs for your LLMs

A workspace serves as your control center for managing the lifecycle of your MCP servers, from configuration to deployment to monitoring.
