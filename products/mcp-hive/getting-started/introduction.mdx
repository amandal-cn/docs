## What is MCP Hive?

MCP Hive is a no-code platform that empowers you to create, discover, and use MCP servers that extend what Large Language Models (LLMs) can do. It solves the challenge of connecting LLMs to external tools and services through a standardized interface.

At its core, MCP Hive lets you:
- Build custom MCP servers without writing code
- Connect LLMs securely to external services
- Discover and use pre-built MCP servers from our marketplace

<Note>
  A hive is a blueprint for an MCP server that defines what capabilities (tools) it offers to LLMs. Learn about MCP Hive's core concepts by following this [guide](/products/mcp-hive/getting-started/key-concepts).
</Note>

## How MCP Hive Works

MCP Hive is built on the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction), which standardizes how LLMs interact with external tools. While MCP defines the standard, implementing it traditionally requires significant technical work. MCP Hive eliminates this complexity.

## Create Your Own Hives

MCP Hive offers two flexible ways to create custom hives:

1. **Convert Existing APIs**: Upload your OpenAPI/Swagger specifications and transform them into MCP-compatible servers instantly
2. **Combine Pre-built Tools**: Mix and match capabilities from our library to create custom solutions without writing code

This flexibility means you can create exactly the right set of capabilities for your specific use case, whether you're building on existing APIs or starting fresh.

Follow this [guide](/products/mcp-hive/getting-started/hive-creators) to learn how to create custom hives.

## Discover and Use Existing Hives as MCP Servers

Browse our growing marketplace of MCP servers to find capabilities that enhance your LLM applications:
- GDrive, Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Calendar
- Slack, Discord, Telegram
- Supabase, Postgres, MySQL
- And much more

Connect to these capabilities instantly without complex setup or integration work.

<Note> 
  MCP Hive standardizes authentication for connecting LLMs to external services:
  - OAuth2 for services like Google Drive and Slack
  - API Keys for various platforms
  - Bearer tokens for authenticated services
  - AWS Signature for Amazon services

We handle the security details automatically, so you can connect your LLMs to external services with confidence.

  <Card title="Accelerate Development" icon="rocket">
    Transform weeks of development into minutes of configuration. Instead of waiting for someone else to build an MCP server or investing significant engineering resources to build your own, MCP Hive gives you the superpower to create production-ready MCP servers instantly. Build exactly what you need, when you need it.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Enterprise-Grade Security" icon="shield-check">
    Connect LLMs to sensitive services with confidence. MCP Hive implements industry-standard authentication protocols (OAuth2, API Keys, Bearer tokens, AWS Signature) with proper credential handling and secure connections, eliminating security vulnerabilities common in custom implementations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Maximize Flexibility" icon="puzzle-piece">
    One-size-fits-all solutions rarely work for AI applications. MCP Hive lets you create exactly the right combination of capabilities for your specific needs, whether by converting your existing APIs or combining pre-built tools in new ways.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Future-Proof Integration" icon="shield-halved">
    As the MCP standard evolves, MCP Hive keeps your implementations up-to-date. Your MCP servers will remain compatible with any MCP-enabled LLM, protecting your investment and ensuring long-term interoperability.
