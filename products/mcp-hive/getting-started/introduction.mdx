## What is MCP Hive?

MCP Hive is the largest [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) marketplace. It helps you discover, create, and manage MCP servers through a unified platform. With MCP Hive, you can:
- Browse and discover existing MCP servers.
- Create your own MCP Servers within minutes, with zero code.
- Authorize LLM to use your MCP servers in a few clicks.

## Key Concepts

### Hive

A hive is a blueprint for an MCP server. It contains the [capabilities](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools) that the MCP server will offer.

<Note>
    Follow [this guide](/getting-started/hive-users) to learn how to use hive as an MCP server.
</Note>

You can create hives in two ways:
1. **From API Specifications**: Convert your existing APIs into an MCP Hive. 
2. **From Existing Tools**: Mix and match existing capabilities to create powerful hives.

<Note>
  Follow our [guides](/getting-started/hive-creators) to learn how to create hives from scratch.

### Workspace

Think of a workspace as your control center. It's where you manage your MCP Servers.
- You can add hives to your workspace. Hives added to workspace can be used as an MCP server.
- You can configure hives added to workspace.  We support standard authentication schemes like OAuths, API Keys, Bearer Tokens, etc and custom authentication schemes. You can also configure base URL of the underlying services within the MCP server.
- Copy connection URLs of hives added to workspace and use them as MCP servers.

### MCP Server

A hive added to a workspace can be used as an MCP server. Follow [this guide](/getting-started/hive-users) to learn how to use hive as an MCP server.


<Note>
  Think of MCP Hive as a bridge between LLM clients and AI capabilities. It helps you package, manage, and deliver these capabilities efficiently!
