Connect to your first MCP server by following these simple steps. You'll learn how to create a workspace, add hives to it, configure and use hive as an MCP server.

### Step by Step Guide
<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Workspace">
    Sign in to MCP Hive and navigate to your workspaces management dashboard. 
    
    Create a new workspace by clicking the `Create New Workspace` button. [Workspaces](/products/mcp-hive/getting-started/key-concepts#workspace) help you organize and manage your hives in one place.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Hives">
    Click on `Add Hive` button and select the hive you want to add to your workspace. You can search for a hive by name or description.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Authorization">
    Click on the `Configure` button against your hive. You can authorize the hive or configure the base URL of the underlying services.

    We support `OAuth2`, `API Key` as well as `HTTP Bearer Token` authorization.
  </Step>

    Click on the `Install` button against your hive. This will open an installation command interface where you can:

    1. Choose your platform: `Claude`, `Cursor`, `Cline`, `Windsurf`

    2. Select execution mode: `Local`, `Remote`
    <Note>
      In local mode, the hive will be running on your machine unlike remote mode where the hive runs on MCP Hive's servers. This is recommended for MCP servers that need access to your local machine like obsidian, filesystem, etc.
    </Note>

    3. Copy the generated installation command (e.g., `npx @mcp-hive/cli@latest install --name google_calendar --client claude`)

    4. Run the command in your terminal. When prompted for an `API Key`:
       - Click on your profile menu
       - Select "Manage API Keys"
       - Generate a new API key if you don't have one
       - Copy and paste the API key into the terminal

    <Note>
    API Key is now required to access Hive as an MCP server irrespective of the execution mode.
