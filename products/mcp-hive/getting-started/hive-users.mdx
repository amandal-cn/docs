Connect to your first MCP server by following these simple steps. You'll learn how to create a workspace, add hives to it, configure and use hive as an MCP server.

### Step by Step Guide
<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Workspace">
    Sign in to MCP Hive and navigate to your workspaces management dashboard. 
    
    Create a new workspace by clicking the `Create New Workspace` button. [Workspaces](/products/mcp-hive/getting-started/key-concepts#workspace) help you organize and manage your hives in one place.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Hives">
    Click on `Add Hive` button and select the hive you want to add to your workspace. You can search for a hive by name or description.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Authorization">
    Click on the `Configure` button against your hive. You can authorize the hive or configure the base URL of the underlying services.

    We support `OAuth2`, `API Key` as well as `HTTP Bearer Token` authorization.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect to MCP Server">
    Click on the `Connect` button against your hive. This will copy the SSE connection URL to your clipboard. You can now use this URL as an SSE-based MCP server.
