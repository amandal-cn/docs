# Troubleshooting Guide for Hive Creators

This guide helps you resolve common issues encountered when creating and testing hives.

## Quick Issue Navigator

| Issue Type | Common Symptoms | Go to Section |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| üîç **Input Validation** | Invalid input, parameter type mismatches | [Validation Errors](#validation-errors) |
| üîí **Authentication** | "Unauthorized" errors, auth failures | [Authorization Errors](#authorization-errors) |
| ‚è±Ô∏è **Timeout** | Tool execution cuts off, connection drops | [Timeout Errors](#timeout-errors) |
| üîå **Connection** | Can't connect, connection drops | [Connection Issues](#connection-issues) |
| üõ†Ô∏è **Tool Invocation** | Tool not recognized or improperly used | [Tool Invocation Problems](#tool-invocation-problems) |

## Validation Errors

If you're invoking a tool but getting validation errors:

### Check Input Parameters
- Verify that inputs match the expected parameter types and structure
- Ensure all required parameters are being passed
- If using simplified schema (through Studio), check the transformation script's logic

### Be Aware of Type Conversions
The MCP SDK automatically converts input values to the closest type:
- `{"team_id": "539"}` will convert to `{"team_id": 539}` (integer)
- `"true"` gets converted to `True` (boolean)

This happens because the SDK runs `json.loads()` on passed values before sending them to the tool. Handle these conversions appropriately in your backend.

## Authorization Errors

When encountering authorization errors in Hive Studio:

1. Verify your hive uses one of our [supported authentication methods](/products/mcp-hive/creators/best-practices#authentication)
2. Check that your test environment is configured correctly if you are testing tools through Studio
![Studio Test Environment](/images/hive-studio-test-environment-setup.png)
3. Ensure credentials are valid and have appropriate permissions
<Note>
For OAuth2, ensure your API spec has all the required scopes and you have selected them while configuring test environment.
</Note>
4. We support OAuth2 for following providers:
- Google
- Slack
- Hubspot
- Sherlock
- Canva

If you are using some other provider or a custom provider, please reach out to us on [GChat](https://chat.google.com/room/AAAA-1lU1zM?cls=7) or mail us at [mandal.ashish@trilogy.com](mailto:mandal.ashish@trilogy.com).

## Timeout Errors

When testing with Claude Desktop, Cursor, or other clients:

- Most clients timeout tool calls after `10 seconds`
- Hive Studio doesn't have this limitation. You can test long-running tools through Studio without any issues.
- **Solution:** Optimize your tools to complete within `10 seconds` when possible

<Note>
We're working on a progress update feature that will allow long-running tools to send progress updates, which should resolve these timeout issues.
</Note>

## Connection Issues

### Connection Drops During Tool Execution
- This is expected behavior for long-running tools due to client timeouts
- **Solution:** Optimize tool execution time or wait for our upcoming progress update feature
- If you need to test again, restart the client (Claude) or refresh (Cursor)

### Unable to Connect to Hive
If a client cannot connect to your hive at all:
1. Test tools through Studio to verify the hive is functioning
2. If Studio tests work, the issue likely lies with the client (Claude/Cursor)
3. Try restarting the client or contact our support team at [GChat](https://chat.google.com/room/AAAA-1lU1zM?cls=7) or mail us at [mandal.ashish@trilogy.com](mailto:mandal.ashish@trilogy.com).

## Tool Invocation Problems

If clients struggle to invoke your tools:

1. Review tool descriptions for clarity and completeness
   - Use AI assist in Studio to improve descriptions
2. Simplify parameter structures
   - Cursor particularly struggles with deeply nested parameters
3. Test with multiple clients
   - If Claude Desktop works but Cursor fails, the issue may be client-specific
   - If both fail, revisit your tool design
