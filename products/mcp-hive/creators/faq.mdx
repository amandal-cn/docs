## General Questions

### What is a hive?
A hive is a collection of LLM capabilities that can be deployed as an MCP server. It can include tools, resources, prompts, and other MCP-compatible capabilities.

### Can I create multiple hives?
Yes, you can create and manage multiple hives. Each hive can serve different purposes or target different use cases.

## Creation Process

### Which API specification formats are supported?
We currently support OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications in versions 2.0 and 3.0+.

### Can I update my hive after publishing?
Yes, you can update your hive's configuration, tools, and documentation after publishing. Version control helps track changes.

### How do I handle authentication for multiple tools?
Each tool can have its own authentication configuration. The workspace manages these credentials securely.

## Usage and Management

### How do users connect to my hive?
Users can connect to your hive through their workspace using the MCP protocol. Each workspace provides a unique connection URL.

### Can I monitor hive usage?

### How do I manage updates and versions?
