This video provides an overview of the Hive Studio, where you'll build and manage your hives. Watching this introduction will help you get familiar with the interface and core workflows.

## Tool Design

### Clear Descriptions
- Ensure tool descriptions are crisp and clear
- Anyone should be able to understand the purpose of the tool and when to use it
- Use Studio's AI assist feature to improve descriptions for each tool

### Simplified Parameters
- Keep input parameters simple without unnecessary nesting
- Remove redundant or unused parameters
- Use Studio to simplify parameter schemas with one click
- Iteratively refine parameters based on testing feedback

### Transformation Scripts
- If you've simplified the input schema, carefully review transformation scripts
- Ensure simplified inputs correctly convert to the original format expected by your API service
- Test transformations with various input types to verify correct behavior

## Authentication

We support these standard authentication systems:
- OAuth2
- API Key
- Bearer Token
- HTTP Basic

**Recommendation:** Test your authentication flow with [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) before onboarding to our platform. If it works there, it should work with Hive as well.

<Note>
Need support for other authentication methods? Contact us on [GChat](https://chat.google.com/room/AAAA-1lU1zM?cls=7) or mail us at [mandal.ashish@trilogy.com](mailto:mandal.ashish@trilogy.com).
</Note>

## Testing

- Test each tool thoroughly before deploying
- Save test cases so you can rerun them in the future with a few clicks

## Hive Documentation

Our system generates:
- Hive descriptions
- Summaries of data models

Ensure these accurately represent your hive:
- Edit manually or use AI assist to refine
- Make sure descriptions capture the purpose of your hive
- Verify data model summaries are accurate and helpful
