    First, install the mcp-proxy tool using one of these commands:
    
    ```bash
    # Option 1: With uv (recommended)
    uv tool install mcp-proxy
    
    # Option 2: With pipx (alternative)
    pipx install mcp-proxy
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Get your MCP Server connection URL">
    Follow the steps in the [Hive Users guide](/products/mcp-hive/getting-started/hive-users#connect-to-mcp-server) to get your SSE connection URL for your hive.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Claude Desktop">
    Add your hive to Claude Desktop by editing the configuration file:
    
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {

          "command": "/Users/amandal/.local/bin/mcp-proxy",
          "args": [
            "https://mcp-server.ti.trilogy.com/641b190b/sse"
          ]
