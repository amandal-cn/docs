        Sign in to MCP Hive and navigate to your workspaces management dashboard. 
        
        Create a new workspace by clicking the `Create New Workspace` button. [Workspaces](/products/mcp-hive/core-concepts#workspaces) help you organize and manage your hives in one place.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Add Hives">
        Click on `Add Hive` button and select the hive you want to add to your workspace. You can search for a hive by name or description.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Configure Authorization">
        Click on the `Configure` button against your hive. You can authorize the hive or configure the base URL of the underlying services.

        We support `OAuth2`, `API Key` as well as `HTTP Bearer Token` authorization.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Connect to MCP Server">
        Click on the `Connect` button against your hive. This will copy the SSE connection URL to your clipboard. You can now use this URL as an SSE-based MCP server.

      <Step title="Choose Creation Method">
        MCP Hive offers two ways to create your hive: API Specification for existing APIs, or Compose from Tools to combine existing capabilities. Select the method that best suits your needs.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Using API Specification">
        Start by uploading your OpenAPI/Swagger specification. Add relevant metadata like name, description, and tags to help users discover your hive. Configure the authentication requirements and review everything before publishing your hive to the marketplace.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Compose from Tools">
        Browse through our collection of existing tools and select the ones you want to combine. Configure how these tools interact with each other, add comprehensive documentation to help users understand your hive's capabilities, and publish it to the marketplace.
      </Step>
