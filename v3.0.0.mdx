## OAuth Token Management Improvements

This update also brings significant improvements to OAuth token handling, making your development workflow smoother and more efficient.

### Automatic Token Refresh

MCP Hive now automatically refreshes expired OAuth tokens, eliminating the need for manual refresh actions that were previously required approximately every hour.

### Scope Preference Memory

Your selected OAuth scopes are now remembered for each hive, removing the need to select them individually each time you connect. This feature saves time and reduces errors when working with multiple hives that require different permission scopes.
